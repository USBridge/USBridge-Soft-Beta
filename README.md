**USBridge Remote** is a unified high-performance client for managing remote machines. I designed it to combine **hardware-level BIOS access** (via USBridge KVM devices) and **software-based remote desktop** in a single, streamlined interface.

> ⚠️ **Beta Software** — This is an early release. Expect bugs. Please report issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/USBridge/USBridge-Remote-Beta/issues) or join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xqQ6ybkfWS) for support.

## Download

### Client
The Client is the control interface — installed on your workstation or laptop. It manages connections, live remote desktop, virtual device passthrough, and snapshot registry.

## Features

![USBridge Remote — Remote Desktop](assets/screenshot_USBridge_client.png)

**One place for everything** — I've unified the workflow. Manage USBridge KVM hardware and software agents from a single dashboard. Add a machine, connect, and you're in.

**No limits, no subscriptions** — Completely free. No session time limits, no connection caps, and no account required on the target machine.

**Low-latency video** — My adaptive streaming engine selects the most efficient protocol based on your connection. Enjoy up to 2K resolution with minimal lag thanks to FFmpeg hardware acceleration (DXGI, AVFoundation, VAAPI).

**Tailscale integration** — Built-in encrypted P2P tunneling. Connect to any machine globally without messing with port forwarding or firewall rules. It works on LAN and over the internet automatically.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the Agent** on the machine you want to access remotely. Launch it — it will display a connection token and Tailscale address. Connect Tailscale if you need access over the internet.

2. **Install the Client** on your workstation, laptop, or phone.

3. **Add a connection** — enter the IP or Tailscale address shown in the Agent window. That's it.
